  <h1>welcome to moveable logic</h1>
  <p>My name is Nicole and I teach computer science, software and transport engineering and related topics at university level. In my spare time I develop Android apps.</p>
  <p>I'm happy to work with teams or groups wanting to develop prototypes or simple apps for research data collection, student-focused productivity apps and mathematics-based apps.</p>
